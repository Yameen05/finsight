"""SEC RAG agent node.

For a given ticker, retrieves chunks from the existing Pinecone index for a
fixed set of canonical research questions and uses gpt-4o-mini to synthesize
each set of chunks into a short answer. Output is a `SECFindings` slot of
`ResearchState`.

Assumes the filing has already been ingested via `POST /filings/ingest`. If the
namespace is empty, returns status="skipped" with a helpful error.
